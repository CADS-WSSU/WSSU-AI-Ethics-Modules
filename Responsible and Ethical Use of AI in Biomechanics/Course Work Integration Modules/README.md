## Course Work Integration Modules
Course Work Integration components 1-4 outline multiple hands-on activities with an LLM (ChatGPT 3.5) on an individual level.  This is accomplished by embedding ancillary assessment into existing course assignments throughout the semester.  This repeated exposure provides ample opportunities to interact with AI and requires the students to utilize an ethical framework (Montreal Declaration) to determine if each interaction is an example of ethical and responsible usage of AI.  Students will be required to submit a written discussion that addresses the provided questions on each interaction.  The following rubric will be used to grade those written submissions.

* 100%	Written assessment and discussion of the situation demonstrates exceptional critical thinking and application of an ethical framework. Provides the required ChatGPT output.
* 90%	Shows moderate ability to synthesize the situation, apply an ethical framework, and form conclusions.  Provides the required ChatGPT output.
* 80%	Demonstrates a basic understanding of responsible AI usage and/or provides limited justification for conclusions on the situation. Provides the required ChatGPT output.
* 70%	Provides limited justification for conclusions on the situation and little reference to an ethical framework. Submits the required ChatGPT output.
* 50%	Submits the ChatGPT output but provides a written discussion with little to no value or no discussion at all.
* 0%	Nothing was submitted.

Grades of 100% are rare.  The student will need to have substantial unique insights provided in the written discussion to earn 100%.  Grades of 90%-80% are more common.  These grades do not indicate that anything is "wrong" with the thoughts in the discussion, just that it doesn't demonstrate exceptional levels of critical thinking and application of the ethical framework.

All submissions are graded based on the rubric provided above and the first 10-15 minutes of the following course meeting will be dedicated to reviewing and discussing the collected thoughts on the AAA. 

Once all submissions have been graded, the first 10-15 minutes of the following course meeting will be dedicated to reviewing and discussing the collected thoughts on the AAA.
