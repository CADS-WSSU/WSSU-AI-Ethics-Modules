# AI Ethics Module in Elementary Statistics
This course module is integrated into MAT 2326 Elementary Statistics course at WSSU. MAT 2326 Elementary Statistics, offered by the Department of Mathematics  focuses on the use of statistics as a tool in the decision-making process. This is a popular General Education course at WSSU and taken by a large number of majors from Nursing, Exercise Science, Mathematics, Biology, and Business departments. Two hands-on projects have been incorporated in MAT 2326 - Elementary Statistics in the Spring 2024 semester to introduce to students the miraculously glamorous power offered by AI and more importantly, to raise their awareness of the hidden-in-plain-sight shortcomings/biases of AI, which are seemingly unbeknownst to the vast majority of students.
## Learning Outcomes of this Module

* Students will learn to evaluate the performance of an AI system such as ChatGPT critically while discerning between its strengths and limitations in order to be able to make informed decisions about its use in various contexts. 
* Students will learn about biases in AI systems and will engage in discussions and initiatives aimed at addressing bias-related issues, promoting fairness and equity.
