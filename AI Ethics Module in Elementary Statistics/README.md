# AI Ethics Module in Elementary Statistics
This course module is integrated into MAT 2326 Elementary Statistics course at WSSU. MAT 2326 Elementary Statistics, offered by the Department of Mathematics aims to analyze the validity of a statistical argument from data-gathering through implementation. This course is primarily taken by Second undergraduate degree and undergraduate students. A list of typical WSSU majors who typically take the course are Nursing, Exercise Science, Mathematics, Biology, and Business. In this module two hands-on projects have been incorporated in MAT 2326 - Elementary Statistics in the Spring 2024 semester to introduce to students the miraculously glamorous power offered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more importantly, to raise their awareness of the hidden-in-plain-sight shortcomings/biases of AI, which are seemingly unbeknownst to the vast majority of students.
## Learning Outcomes of this Module
