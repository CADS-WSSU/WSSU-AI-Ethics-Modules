# Assessment of the Student Learning Experience

Two different mechanisms will be utilized in assessing the student learning experience. First, a before/after assessment will be used to simply gauge the degree to which students have thought about these issues in advance, and the second will be to use the same mechanisms that are currently used in the business ethics course to assess student learning.

For the before/after assessment, prior to the first day of each case study in the module, students will be asked to simply conceptualize whether it is ethical to utilize AI in each of the above cases and why, and to bring in a written assessment of each of these items.

On the last day of each case study in the module, in addition to other questions that are being asked, students will be asked to answer the exact same question, and then the two answers will be compared to see if students changed their perspectives and, if so, how their perspectives changed.

The assessment will focus on the following:
1. To what degree is a consistent ethical framework utilized by the student to devise a solution to the issue at hand, and to what degree is it not utilized, and where can the student better incorporate ethical frameworks (consequentialist ethics, deontological ethics, virtue ethics) to answer these questions?
2. To what degree is the analysis given by the student based on facts that are consistent with the issues that are raised in the case study or question?
3. To what extent are all of the issues raised in the case study addressed by the student with a cogent argument that is informed by moral and ethical theories?

For this course, all five evaluation criteria of the Ethical Reasoning Value Rubric developed by AACU were utilized. This rubric can be downloaded from [here](https://www.aacu.org/initiatives/value-initiative/value-rubrics/value-rubrics-ethical-reasoning).
