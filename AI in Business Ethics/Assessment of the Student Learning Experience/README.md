# Assessment of the Student Learning Experience

In assessing the student learning experience, I will utilize two different mechanisms.  First, a before/after assessment to simply gauge the degree to which students have thought about these issues in advance and the second would be to use the same mechanisms that I currently do in my business ethics course to assess student learning:

For the before/after assessment, prior to the first day of each case study in the module, I am asking students to simply conceptualize whether it is ethical to utilize AI in each of the above cases and why and to bring in a written assessment of each of these items. 

On the last day of each case study in the module, in addition to other questions that are being asked, I am asking students to answer the exact same question and then I will compare the two answers to see if students changed their perspective and, if so, how they changed their perspective.

(1)	To what degree does the student utilize a consistent ethical framework to devise a solution to the issue at hand and, to the degree they do not, where can the student better incorporate ethical frameworks (consequentialist ethics, deontological ethics, virtue ethics) to answer these questions?  

(2)	To what degree is the analysis given by the student based on facts that are consistent with the issues that are raised in the case study or question?

(3)	To what extent does the student address all of the issues raised in the case study with a cogent argument that is informed by moral and ethical theories?
