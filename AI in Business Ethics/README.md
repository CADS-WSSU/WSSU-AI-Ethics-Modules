# AI in Business Ethics
Course Description: “This course examines the ethical dimensions of business and the role ethics plays in sound business decisions and a healthy workplace environment. Various ethical theories and corporate models will be studied. Practical application of ethical theory will be discussed through case study analysis, study of various corporate ethics codes, and student research of current ethical issues in business.”

## Learning Outcomes
* To what degree does the student utilize a consistent ethical framework to devise a solution to the issue at hand and, to the degree they do not, where can the student better incorporate ethical frameworks (consequentialist ethics, deontological ethics, virtue ethics) to answer these questions?
* To what degree is the analysis given by the student based on facts that are consistent with the issues that are raised in the case study or question?
* To what extent does the student address all of the issues raised in the case study with a cogent argument that is informed by moral and ethical theories?

## Specific Learning Outcomes from this particular module:
The following five learning outcomes are taken from the Responsible AI workshop put together by Professors Debzani Deb and Greg Taylor of Winston-Salem State University and thus closely parallel the learning outcomes that they gave in order to ensure comparability.
* LO1 (The student will analyze the fundamental principles that consciously or unconsciously influence one’s ethical conduct and ethical thinking to be assessed through written assignments that require the student to discuss these fundamental principles in analyzing at least one of the case studies)
* LO2 (Student will understand the different AI ethical principles and concepts as well as understand the Montreal Framework and name/explain several of its key principles to be assessed through written assignments that require the student to discuss these in the context of the problem under consideration)
* LO3 (Student will recognize ethical issues when presented in the form of a case study and recognize cross-relationships among the issues to be assessed through a debate)
* LO4 (Student will apply ethical perspectives/concepts independently to an ethical question to be assessed through a debate)
* LO5 (Student will evaluate different AI ethical perspectives by stating a position regarding an ethical problem and reasonably defend his or her position through a debate)
Each case study incorporates all five elements since students cannot evaluate an ethical problem and provide a position without applying, recognizing, understanding, and analyzing in accordance with each of the other learning goals.  The student’s work will be assessed using the AAC&U Ethical Reasoning VALUE Rubric available at VALUE Rubrics - Ethical Reasoning | AAC&U (aacu.org)
