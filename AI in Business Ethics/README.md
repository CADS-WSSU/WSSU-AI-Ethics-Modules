# AI in Business Ethics
This course module is integrated into BUA 3302 Business Ethics course at WSSU. BUA 3302 is offered as an elective course to Business and Finance majors at WSSU. This course examines the ethical dimensions of business and the role ethics plays in sound business decisions and a healthy workplace environment. In this module, five different AI case studies are followed, each one presenting an ethical dilemma for business leaders. Throughout this module, business students examine the various problems from different sides in order to determine what they believe to be a proper moral outcome. The key to all of
this is to demonstrate to students that there are different solutions to each problem and that there is not one unique solution that can always be implemented.

## Learning Outcomes

* The student will analyze the fundamental principles that consciously or unconsciously influence oneâ€™s ethical conduct and ethical thinking to be assessed through written assignments that require the student to discuss these fundamental principles in analyzing at least one of the case studies
* Student will understand the different AI ethical principles and concepts as well as understand the Montreal Framework and name/explain several of its key principles to be assessed through written assignments that require the student to discuss these in the context of the problem under consideration
* Student will recognize ethical issues when presented in the form of a case study and recognize cross-relationships among the issues to be assessed through a debate
* Student will apply ethical perspectives/concepts independently to an ethical question to be assessed through a debate
* Student will evaluate different AI ethical perspectives by stating a position regarding an ethical problem and reasonably defend his or her position through a debate
