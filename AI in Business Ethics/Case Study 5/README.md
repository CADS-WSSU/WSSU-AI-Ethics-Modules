# Case Study 5: The Implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI)
Do we need to have a Universal Basic Income to deal with the societal implications of AI replacing jobs? Students will play the role of a member of Congress debating the implementation of UBI.

## Goals 
*	To make students aware of the job displacement that AI can have and discuss possible mitigation strategies to deal with the economic and societal fallout
  
## Key Philosophical Questions
* Should we make everyone a shareholder in the new economy or will we become a technofeudal society?
* How is this question impacted by the 10 principles of the Montreal Declaration?

## Tags 
* Principle of Well-Being
* Principle of Respect for Autonomy
* Principle of Protection of Privacy and Intimacy
* Principle of Solidarity
* Principle of Democratic Participation
* Principle of Equity
* Principle of Diversity Inclusion
* Principle of Prudence

## Implementation within a two day a week course
Prior to the first class for the week, students are to complete the reading assignments and watch the videos and to come in with a written statement that answers the question: 
* Should we make everyone a shareholder in the new economy or will we become a technofeudal society?

During the first class, students are to break up into small groups to address the first five principles of the Montreal Declaration and how they impact the answer to this question. 

There is no outside activity for this particular case study because this is more about how we need to react to AI than an application of AI itself.

During the second class, students will be asked to discuss the second five principles of the Montreal Declaration and how they impact the answer to this question.

Students will then do a short (2 to 4-page) paper answering the two philosophical questions that were detailed for themselves with reference to both the debate and class readings that will be due 
the following week.  Note that the first question on whether we should make everyone a shareholder in the new economy or will we become a technofeudal society is the same question as the pre-question for this module.
