## Description
In this module, five different case studies are followed, each one presenting an ethical dilemma for business leaders.  Throughout this module, business students will examine the various problems from different sides in order to determine what they believe to be a proper moral outcome.  The key to all of this is to demonstrate to students that there are different solutions to each problem and that there is not one unique solution that can always be implemented.  Each solution will have different benefits and costs and students will need to examine these in order to understand the proper role of how to utilize AI in a business setting.  This will require students to see how different aspects of the Montreal Protocol may come into conflict with one another as well as how different ethical perspectives can lead us to different outcomes.  The most important lesson from all of these is to engage of wide variety of stakeholders in order to come to a proper understanding of the question and devise an acceptable solution to the that are presented.  Each case study will take one week of class time.  Prior to starting the module, students will be asked to do a write-up answering the following five questions and will be asked why they chose to answer the question in the way that they did.
Students will learn the Montreal Declaration’s ten guiding principles that are reproduced here from a document authored by Professor Debzani Deb of Winston-Salem State University:
##AI Ethics Principles/Guidelines
Montreal (https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration/)
1.	Well-being
The development and use of artiﬁcial intelligence systems (AIS) must permit the growth of the well-being of all sentient beings.
2.	Autonomy
AIS must be developed and used while respecting people’s autonomy, and with the goal of increasing people’s control over their lives and their surroundings.
3.	Privacy and Intimacy
Privacy and intimacy must be protected from AIS intrusion and data acquisition and archiving systems (DAAS).
4.	Solidarity
The development of AIS must be compatible with maintaining the bonds of solidarity among people and generations.
5.	Democratic Participation 
AIS must meet intelligibility, justifiability, and accessibility criteria, and must be subjected to democratic scrutiny, debate, and control.
6.	Equity
The development and use of AIS must contribute to the creation of a just and equitable society.
7.	Diversity Inclusion
The development and use of AIS must be compatible with maintaining social and cultural diversity and must not restrict the scope of lifestyle choices or personal experiences.
8.	Prudence
Every person involved in AI development must exercise caution by anticipating, as far as possible, the adverse consequences of AIS use and by taking the appropriate measures to avoid them.
9.	Responsibility
The development and use of AIS must not contribute to lessening the responsibility of human beings when decisions must be made.
10.	Sustainable Development
The development and use of AIS must be carried out so as to ensure a strong environmental sustainability of the planet.”
These principles will be tested on the course final examination in the form of a definitions section that will require students to write out what each principle means when they see the principle listed and to provide a brief example of how each principle might be violated and another example of how each principle might be upheld (LO2).
## Learning Outcomes
The following five learning outcomes are taken from the Responsible AI workshop put together by Professors Debzani Deb and Greg Taylor of Winston-Salem State University and thus closely parallel the learning outcomes they gave to ensure comparability.

* The student will analyze the fundamental principles that consciously or unconsciously influence one’s ethical conduct and ethical thinking to be assessed through written assignments that require the student to discuss these fundamental principles in analyzing at least one of the case studies
* Student will understand the different AI ethical principles and concepts as well as understand the Montreal Framework and name/explain several of its key principles to be assessed through written assignments that require the student to discuss these in the context of the problem under consideration
* Student will recognize ethical issues when presented in the form of a case study and recognize cross-relationships among the issues to be assessed through a debate
* Student will apply ethical perspectives/concepts independently to an ethical question to be assessed through a debate
* Student will evaluate different AI ethical perspectives by stating a position regarding an ethical problem and reasonably defend his or her position through a debate Each case study incorporates all five elements since students cannot evaluate an ethical problem and provide a position without applying, recognizing, understanding, and analyzing in accordance with each of the other learning goals.

## Assessment Rubric
The student’s work will be assessed using the AAC&U Ethical Reasoning VALUE Rubric available at VALUE Rubrics - [Ethical Reasoning | AAC&U (aacu.org)](https://www.aacu.org/initiatives/value-initiative/value-rubrics/value-rubrics-ethical-reasoning) 

For this course, all five evaluation criteria of the ER Value Rubric were utilized. For convenience, the AACU Value Rubric is also provided below:
