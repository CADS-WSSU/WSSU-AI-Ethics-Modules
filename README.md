# AI Ethics Course Modules at WSSU 
### Description
This repository contains seven course modules designed to integrate AI Ethics into interdisciplinary courses at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), developed by the Center for Applied Data Science (CADS) at WSSU. The initiative aims to promote engagement in Responsible AI practices, as part of a grant funded by Mozilla Fiundation's [Responsible Computing Challenge award](https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration/) [Responsible Computing Challenge award] (https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/mozilla-announces-15-new-responsible-computing-challenge-awardees-in-the-us/).
This repository is intended to be a central open-source resource for all modules and materials created as part of the program. These resources can be used for reference or adoption to increase awareness about the ethical use of AI among students at various academic levels.

### What is AI Ethics 
AI ethics involves guiding principles for the responsible use of artificial intelligence to ensure alignment with ethical standards and the well-being of individuals and society. There are many sets of AI ethics principles available created by renowned organizations. For this project, we have followed the principles described by [Montreal](https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration/) and [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics). We chose the UNESCO principles because they are universal principles adopted by 193 Nations (the US is not a member in 2021), and the Montreal principles align with WSSU values. Faculty members were free to choose from either or both of these principles, as they would broaden student perspectives on AI ethics. The key points of both sets of principles are described below:

* The Montréal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence - 10 Principles:
   
  i) Well-Being  ii) Respect for autonomy iii) Protection of privacy and intimacy iv) Solidarity v) Democratic participation vi) Equity vii) Diversity inclusion viii) Prudence ix) Responsibility x) Sustainable development

* Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence by UNESCO - 10 Principles:
   
  i) Proportionality and Do No Harm  ii) Safety and Security iii) Right to Privacy and Data Protection iv) Multi-stakeholder and Adaptive Governance & Collaboration v) Responsibility and Accountability vi) Transparency and Explainability vii) Human Oversight and Determination viii) Sustainability ix) Awareness & Literacy x) Fairness and Non-Discrimination

### Rubric and Assessment
Faculty members have used the Ethical Reasoning Value Rubric developed by AACU (The American Association of Colleges and Universities) to assess students. This rubric consists of 5 evaluation criteria that will be used to grade students. Faculty members had the option to choose any combination of criteria or use all of them for evaluation. The AACU ER Value Rubric can be found [here](https://www.aacu.org/initiatives/value-initiative/value-rubrics/value-rubrics-ethical-reasoning). For convenience, the rubric is also presented below:

### News Article 
WSSU received a Responsible Computing Challenge Grant Award from the Mozilla Foundation for the project, said Dr. Debzani Deb, the project’s principal investigator, RJ Reynolds endowed professor of computer science, and founding director of WSSU’s Center for Applied Data Science (CADS). The award is administered by CADS, which is leading the effort of integrating active learning course modules on responsible and ethical AI into seven interdisciplinary courses at WSSU during the spring 2024 semester.
