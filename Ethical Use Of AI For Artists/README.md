# Ethical Use Of AI For Artists
In this module, students will be presented various approaches to learn the ethical uses of AI in image generation. This will help them become aware of the issue, prepare their ethical positions, present their views in rich context and finally to produce artwork without fear or harm using AI ethically.

## Learning Outcomes of this Module

* Students will DISCUSS the general ethics involved in AI in the visual arts (aware) 
* Students will READ about AI and specific UNESCO and Montreal Ethical positions on AI (prepare) 
* Students will ROLE PLAY a hypothetical professional scenario (present) 
* Students will CREATE using AI in 3 different ethically appropriate approaches (produce)
