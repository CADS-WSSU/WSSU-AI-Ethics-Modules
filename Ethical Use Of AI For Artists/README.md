# Ethical Use Of AI For Artists
In this module, students will be presented various approaches to learn the ethical uses of AI in image generation. This will help them become aware of the issue, prepare their ethical positions, present their views in rich context and finally to produce artwork without fear or harm using AI ethically.

## Learning Outcomes of this Module

* Students will gain a basic understanding of the current capacity of AI technology in the field of biomechanics.
* Students will recognize the ethical implications of using AI at an individual level for academic work and in societal applications.
* Students will effectively use open-source generative AI (ChatGPT 3.5) in an ethical and responsible manner to evaluate coursework and provide accurate practice problems for course topics.
* Students will critically evaluate the use of AI in individual and societal level situations to determine ethical and responsible usage via an established ethical framework.
