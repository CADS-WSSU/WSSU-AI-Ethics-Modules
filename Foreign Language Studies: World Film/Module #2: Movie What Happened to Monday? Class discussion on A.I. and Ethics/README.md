Class discussion on What Happened to Monday? 

### AI Ethical Issue Recognition: 
Can the student recognize ethical issues when presented in the movie and recognize cross relationships among the issues? They must refer to the theory learned the previous week.
This will be assessed via an oral—recorded video— or written report students will post on Canvas. I will use the rubric on AI.
### Question for the discussion board
* Understanding different AI Ethical principles/concepts: Can the student understand at least one ethical framework (Unesco, Montreal) and name/explain several principles? 


* AI Ethical Issue Recognition: Can the student recognize ethical issues when presented in a movie scene and recognize cross relationships among the issues? A typical question to assess this could be “Presented with a particular scene, do you recognize one or many ethical problems and why?”

The question to assess this will be posted on the discussion board: 
* What is an ethical problem listed in the Montreal Declaration and a related principle from UNESCO and portrayed in the movie What Happened to Monday? and why?
  
 Students will post their answer in at least 250 words and reply to two classmates’ posts in at least 100 words. The reply should include a comment and a follow-up question. They can also choose to reply to a question posted to them.
