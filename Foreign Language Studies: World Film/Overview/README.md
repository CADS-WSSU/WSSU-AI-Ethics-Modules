## Learning Outcomes 
* Students demonstrate awareness of the ethical dimension of AI and technologies, able to reason about the issues and communicate the issues to others.
* Students make relevant, valuable original contributions to discussion forums that identify and address ethical issues portrayed in world films.
## Course Plan
The modules were covered within weeks 6 to 9 in a typical 16-week class. 
1. Week 1: AI theory. In class activity: each pair of students will be assigned one principle from the
Montreal Declaration and a related principle from UNESCO Recommendations. You will
compare your summaries of the book chapter, compare the two principles, and relate them back to
the chapter. Also, give any examples of the two assigned principles in the three films previously
studied. Assignment: Must present their results orally for a grade.

2. Week 2: What Happened to Monday? (Europe, 2017) In class: We watch some scenes together
and go over a summary of the UNESCO and Montreal Declaration on AI and ethics.
Assignment: What ethical problem is listed in the Montreal Declaration and a related principle
from UNESCO and portrayed in the movie What Happened to Monday? Why? Post your answer
and justification in at least 250 words. You may choose to write or record yourself. Due by
Sunday.

3. Week 3: My Holo Love (South Korea, 2020). There are twelve episodes in this series. We discuss
3 per class period, watch a few select scenes and discuss ethical issues as well as some positive
aspects of having a hologram helping with day-to-day activities, particularly someone with a
disability such as one of the protagonist’s.

4. Week 4:
* My Holo Love article analysis in class and continue the discussion on the series.
Discussion board due by Sunday. Prompt: State your position regarding an ethical problem in My Holo
Love and reasonably defend your position. What are the threats of artificial intelligence in the series My
Holo Love? Specifically, how does Holo violate the Montreal Declaration and/or UNESCO
Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence? What threats are most serious? How might they
be combated? How do they compare to the potential benefits? Respond to two classmates in 100 words
each response.

* Class discussion of article “Virtual Technology in Netflix K-Drama: Augmented Reality, Hologram, and Artificial Intelligence."

### AI Ethics Principles/guidelines
UNESCO (https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics)

Ten core principles lay out a human-rights centered approach to the Ethics of AI.
1. Proportionality and Do No Harm
The use of AI systems must not go beyond what is necessary to achieve a legitimate
aim. Risk assessment should be used to prevent harms which may result from such uses.
2. Safety and Security
Unwanted harms (safety risks) as well as vulnerabilities to attack (security risks) should
be avoided and addressed by AI actors.
3. Right to Privacy and Data Protection
Privacy must be protected and promoted throughout the AI lifecycle. Adequate data
protection
frameworks should also be established.
4. Multi-stakeholder and Adaptive Governance & Collaboration
International law & national sovereignty must be respected in the use of data.
Additionally, participation of diverse stakeholders is necessary for inclusive approaches
to AI governance.
5. Responsibility and Accountability
AI systems should be auditable and traceable. There should be oversight, impact
assessment, audit and due diligence mechanisms in place to avoid conflicts with human
rights norms and threats to environmental wellbeing.
6. Transparency and Explainability
The ethical deployment of AI systems depends on their transparency & explainability
(T&E). The level of T&E should be appropriate to the context, as there may be tensions
between T&E and other principles such as privacy, safety, and security.
7. Human Oversight and Determination
Member States should ensure that AI systems do not displace ultimate human
responsibility and accountability.
8. Sustainability
AI technologies should be assessed against their impacts on ‘sustainability’, understood
as a set of constantly evolving goals including those set out in the UN’s Sustainable
Development Goals.
9. Awareness & Literacy
Public understanding of AI and data should be promoted through open & accessible
education, civic engagement, digital skills & AI ethics training, media & information
literacy.
10. Fairness and Non-Discrimination
AI actors should promote social justice, fairness, and non-discrimination while taking
an inclusive approach to ensure AI’s benefits are accessible to all.

Montreal (https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration/)
1. Well-being
The development and use of artificial intelligence systems (AIS) must permit the growth of the
well-being of all sentient beings.
2. Autonomy
AIS must be developed and used while respecting people’s autonomy, and with the goal of
increasing people’s control over their lives and their surroundings.
3. Privacy and Intimacy
Privacy and intimacy must be protected from AIS intrusion and data acquisition and archiving
systems (DAAS).
4. Solidarity
The development of AIS must be compatible with maintaining the bonds of solidarity among
people and generations.
5. Democratic Participation
AIS must meet intelligibility, justifiability, and accessibility criteria, and must be subjected to
democratic scrutiny, debate, and control.
6. Equity
The development and use of AIS must contribute to the creation of a just and equitable society.
7. Diversity Inclusion
The development and use of AIS must be compatible with maintaining social and cultural
diversity and must not restrict the scope of lifestyle choices or personal experiences.
8. Prudence
Every person involved in AI development must exercise caution by anticipating, as far as
possible, the adverse consequences of AIS use and by taking the appropriate measures to avoid them.
9. Responsibility
The development and use of AIS must not contribute to lessening the responsibility of human
beings when decisions must be made.
10. Sustainable Development
The development and use of AIS must be carried out to ensure a strong environmental
sustainability of the planet.

## Assessment Rubric
The student’s work will be assessed using the AAC&U Ethical Reasoning VALUE Rubric available at VALUE Rubrics - [Ethical Reasoning | AAC&U (aacu.org)](https://www.aacu.org/initiatives/value-initiative/value-rubrics/value-rubrics-ethical-reasoning) 

For this course, three evaluation criteria of the ER Value Rubric were utilized: Understand Perspectives/Concepts, Issue Recognition, and Apply Perspectives / Concepts. For convenience, the AACU Value Rubric is also provided below:
