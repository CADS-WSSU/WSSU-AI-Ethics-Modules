## Module #1: Study of Russell and Norvig’s chapter on Philosophy, Ethics, and Safety of AI
Study of Russell and Norvig’s chapter on Philosophy, Ethics, and Safety of AI. Students will read the chapter at home and come to class with a summary of the chapter. Also, they will analyze AI Ethics Principles/guidelines according to Montreal ("The MontréAl Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence") and UNESCO ("Recommendations on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence"). 

### In-class activity: 
Each pair of students will be assigned one principle from the [Montreal Declaration](https://montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration/) and a related principle from [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics).  They will compare their summaries of the book chapter, compare the two principles, and relate them back to the chapter.  Also, give any examples of the two assigned principles in the three films previously studied. Must upload their notes/findings for a grade.
