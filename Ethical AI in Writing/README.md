# Ethical AI in Writing
This course is presented as a research project, which will integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics literacy into Advanced Composition at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) and measure its efficacy. Throughout the semester, students will participate in interrogation of the use of AI in composition and rhetorical studies. More specifically, look at the ethics, impact, and implications for the discipline. 


## Learning Outcomes of this Module

* **Ethical Self-Awareness:** The student will demonstrate an ethical self-awareness of the fundamental principles that consciously or unconsciously influence oneâ€™s ethical conduct and ethical thinking.
* **Understanding different AI Ethical principles/concepts:** The student will demonstrate an understanding of the different AI ethical frameworks and be able to explain the principles. 
* **AI Ethical Issue Recognition:** The student will demonstrate the ability to recognize ethical issues when presented in a form of case-study/situation/roleplay and recognize cross relationships among the issues.
* **Application of AI Ethical Perspectives/Concepts:** The student will demonstrate the ability to apply AI ethical perspectives independently in written and oral communication.
* **Evaluation of different AI ethical perspectives/concepts:** The student will be able to state a position regarding an ethical problem and reasonably defend her position.
