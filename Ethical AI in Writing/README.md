# Ethical AI in Writing
This course is presented as a research project, which will integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics literacy into Advanced Composition at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) and measure its efficacy. Throughout the semester, students will participate in interrogation of the use of AI in composition and rhetorical studies. More specifically, look at the ethics, impact, and implications for the discipline. This course is typically offered to English majors; however, accounting, nursing, education, and business administration majors have taken this course.


## Learning Outcomes of this Module
* Students will apply ethical and responsible AI principles in the writing process.
* Students will demonstrate a deep understanding of ethical implications and responsible AI usage as they assess.
* Students will learn effective revision strategies by using AI to analyze their writing for redundancy, readability, and coherence, allowing them to make informed revision decisions.
* Students will demonstrate an understanding of digital literacy, including the ability to navigate, use, and critically evaluate AI tools and technologies.
