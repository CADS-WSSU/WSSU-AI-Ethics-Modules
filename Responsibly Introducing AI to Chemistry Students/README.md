# Responsibly Introducing AI to Chemistry Students
CHE 1114 Chemistry, offered by the Department of Chemistry, consists of a series of laboratories that reinforce the concepts being studied in lecture (CHE 1314). This is a foundational course taken primarily by sophomores, with several
freshman and juniors also enrolled. This module seeks to infuse experience with AI models into chemistry laboratory courses with the goal of training students on how to recognize AI works and how to responsibly and ethically utilize AI models in
higher education.

## Learning Outcomes of this Module

- Students should recognize capabilities and limitations of AI models.
  -	Recognize patterns in AI responses.
  -	Examine veracity of answers provided.
-	Students should be able to describe the ethical implications of using AI models in their work.
    - Can AI models assist them in learning? Designing quizzes, flashcards, mneumonics.
    - How can abusing AI for quick answers harm them, their peers, or others?
- Students should design processes to utilize AI models (current and future) to advance chemistry research.
    - Examine characteristics of soil types and ions to predict level of interaction.
    - Need for accessible data to train AIs.
